# cs50x-homepage

Here you'll find the source code for cs50's pset8 : homepage

Built with HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap

The idea is to build a website to present and promote a business conference, and allow visitors to register at the conference, through a form.

On the registration page, you can try the form, test the different requirements to fill it properly (required fields, and format for some inputs). 

Once you've filled correctly the form and submitted your request, the form should be hidden, and the page should display a confirmation message. 

The JS console should also log an object, containing the infos, you've submitted.
